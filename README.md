# OGLE-Engine
This repository is an archive of my first try of making my first game engine. It is NOT meant to actually be used.  
The purpose of this project was my introduction to create an incredibly simplified 2d Game engine with C++, with future plans for C#-scripting. 

As of writing this, the engine lacks a lot of core functionalit, and is the result of improper planning and beginners naievty.
