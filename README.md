# OGLE-Engine
This project is not meant to be used by any means. 
The purpose of this project is to create a easy to use 2d Game engine with C++, and in the future C#-scripting. 
As of writing this, it lacks a lot of features as the main architecture is still being developed.

DO NOT expect this puppy to work out of the box in it's current state.
